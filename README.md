# Mission to Mars

![mission_to_mars](mission_to_mars.jpg)

In this project we built a web application that scraped various websites for data related to Mars which was then displayed on a single HTML page.

Scraping and analysis were completed using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.  Mongo DB with Flask templating was used to create the HTML page that displays the data scraped from the various websites.
